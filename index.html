    <h2>WEATHER PREDICTION HISTORY:</h2>
    </div>
    <p>The first ever daily weather forecasts were published in The Times on August 1, 1861, and the first weather maps were produced later in the same year.In 1911, the Met Office began issuing the first marine weather forecasts via radio transmission. These included gale and storm warnings for areas around Great Britain.In the United States, the first public radio forecasts were made in 1925 by Edward B. "E.B." Rideout, on WEEI, the Edison Electric Illuminating station in Boston.Rideout came from the U.S. Weather Bureau, as did WBZ weather forecaster G. Harold Noyes in 1931.In the early 19th century, British Royal Navy officer Sir Francis Beaufort developed the wind force scale to classify wind speeds.</p>

    <div class="none">
    <li>Hurricane Tracking: In the 19th century, systematic hurricane tracking in the Atlantic Ocean began with the work of William C. Redfield in the 1830s.</li>
        <li>The Farmers' Almanac: The Old Farmer's Almanac, first published in 1792,popular source of weather information in the United States.</li>
        <li>Barometers and Weather Instruments: The development of weather instruments like barometers, thermometers,atmospheric pressure, temperature, and wind speed.</li>
        <li>Storm Warnings: In the mid-19th centuryhurricane predictions and the establishment of the U.S. Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service).</li>
        <li>Numerical Weather Models: In the 20th century, the use of numerical weather models and computer technology significantly improved weather predictions,20th century.</li>
        <li>Satellite Technology: The launch of weather satellites, such as TIROS-1 in 1960, revolutionized weather monitoring and global weather</li>
        <li>Climate Change Predictions: In recent decades, climate scientists have made long-term predictionsclimate data and advanced computer models.</li>
        <li>Weather Forecasting Agencies: National meteorological agencies, like the United States' utilizing a combination of observational data, satellite technology, and computer modeling.</li>
