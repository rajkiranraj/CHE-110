    <h2>WEATHER PREDICTION HISTORY</h2>
    <p>The first ever daily weather forecasts were published in The Times on August 1, 1861, and the first weather maps were produced later in the same year.In 1911, the Met Office began issuing the first marine weather forecasts via radio transmission. These included gale and storm warnings for areas around Great Britain.In the United States, the first public radio forecasts were made in 1925 by Edward B. "E.B." Rideout, on WEEI, the Edison Electric Illuminating station in Boston.Rideout came from the U.S. Weather Bureau, as did WBZ weather forecaster G. Harold Noyes in 1931.In the early 19th century, British Royal Navy officer Sir Francis Beaufort developed the wind force scale to classify wind speeds.</p> <br> <br>
